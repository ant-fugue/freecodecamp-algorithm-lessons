// summary of a Circular Queue

// A circular queue is a queue that writes to the end of a collection
// then begins overwriting itself at the beginning of the collection

// expected results:

// The enqueue method should add items to the circular queue -> okðŸ˜€
// You should not enqueue items past the read pointer -> noðŸ˜°
// The dequeue method should dequeue items from the queue ->  okðŸ˜€
// After an item is dequeued, its position in the queue should be reset to null -> okðŸ˜€
// Trying to dequeue past the write pointer
// The dequeue method should dequeue items from the queue -> noðŸ˜°
